# Age of Guild Game Project | 2PROJ
Introduction

Anblisoft, a leading video game publisher, is looking for a development team to create an Age of War game. The objective of this project is to provide a stable and saleable version that meets the stated specifications. The team is free to use any language and technology, but cannot copy or adapt existing code, use no-code game-making apps, in-game map editors, or blueprint-type tools.

## Presentation

Age of War is a mix between a defense game and a strategy game. The goal is to destroy the enemy base while defending yours. You can build turrets to defend your base and units to attack the enemy's. The twist of the game is that you can evolve and unlock new units and defense means. The more you evolve, the more powerful you become. Also the 4 level of IA.

## Specifications

The project includes two specifications: a development-oriented subject and a game-design-oriented subject. The team must choose between these two subjects and meet the expectations of the chosen one.

### Units

- Produce units to be sent to the enemy base by attacking anything in the path
- Limited to 10 units simultaneously
- Producing units takes time, and a queue can be created
- 4 types of unit: Infantry, Support, Anti-Armor, Heavy
- Each unit has different characteristics: Price, HP, Damage, Hit Speed, Build Time, Type, Walk Speed, and Range
- Killing an enemy unit gives gold and experience

### Turrets

- Can build up to 4 turrets on your base to defend yourself, each location costing money to unlock
- Have different characteristics: Price, Damage, Hit Speed, and Range
- Selling a turret returns only 50% of the gold spent

### Specials

- Use experience to move (evolve) to the next Age (there are 6 different ones)
- Can spend experience to use a power that randomly hits units in the field (the more advanced the Age, the greater the damage and precision/strike)
- This power has a cooldown

### Upgrades

- Can upgrade a certain type of unit to make it more powerful and take the advantage in the fight
- There is an upgrade that unlocks a unit type initially locked at each Age (Heavy)
- The other upgrades are definitive, but each tier costs more and more
- Different upgrades: Infantry Damage, Support Damage, Anti-Armor Damage, Heavy Damage, Turret Damage, Support Range, Turret Range, Infantry HP, Anti-Armor HP, Heavy HP, Gold per Kill

### Evolve

- Evolving to the next Age requires a certain number of experience points
- Once unlocked by a player, the game's background is changed
- The evolving player unlocks new units, towers, and specials, increases base hit points, and gets a new base design
